# Bike-Buyer-Behavior-Analysis-Project-Using-Excel

I'm excited to share my recent project where I analyzed customer buying behavior to understand what factors influence the decision to purchase a bike.

🔍 Objective:
The goal was to uncover key patterns in demographics, income, job roles, and other factors that differentiate bike buyers from non-buyers — helping support targeted marketing and product strategies.

📈 Key Areas Explored:

🎯 Buyer Demographics

Percentage of customers who purchased a bike

Gender distribution among bike buyers

Age correlation with bike purchases

Impact of marital status on purchase likelihood

💼 Professional Profile

Top job titles among bike buyers

Bike purchase trends among homeowners vs renters

🌍 Regional Trends

Regions/states with the highest number of bike buyers

Urban vs suburban purchase behavior

📊 Combined Insights

Bike purchase rates among married males with income above ₹60,000

Defining the "ideal bike buyer" profile using key filters (e.g., Male, Married, Income > ₹50K, Homeowner)

This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, pivot tables, and insightful storytelling through Excel 📊✨
